Welcome to BDPotentiometer's documentation!
===========================================

**BDPotentiometer** is a Python library for easy control of digital potentiometers.
It has modular design, which allows to use any communication interface (SPI, I2C, UART) and any backend.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.

.. note::

   For now only `gpiozero <https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io>`_ SPI backend is implemented, but the project is under active development and soon more backends will become available.
